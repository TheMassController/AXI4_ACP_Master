This VHDL library provides an interface into the AXI4 ACP Master.

The library is tested using GHDL, and the tb file is written with GHDL in mind.

The AXI 4 master allows for generic data width and address width, starting from 2**5 (=32) for both.
It requires the input addresses and data to be 32 bit and the input address to be 32 bit aligned.
This is the reasoning behind the *ADDR being 2 lines less then expected.
It will assume that the slave wants the data aligned to 2**address_width_log2b, and act accordingly, recalculating addresses and setting write strobes as required.
It does not allow bursting, so sending the width of the data bus is the best you can do in one go.
The reading part and the writing part are independend.
The reading part waits for a response from the AXI bus before finishing.
